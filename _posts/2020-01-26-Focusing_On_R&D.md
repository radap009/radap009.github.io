title: Focusing On R&D Would Drive Corporate Valuation Even in The Short Term
---

Gone are the days when R&D was a dead weight on the financials of a company and it looks like investors are paying a premium for companies with good R&D teams. Running a linear regression on the fundamentals of a company that relate to the market cap shows that R&D spending along with margins and growth is a key factor in driving market cap.

Companies that have the cash to spend as actually spending on R&D, not just to not go obsolete but also to deliver shareholder value. Especially in a good economy, spending on R&D has a direct relation to the premium investors are willing to pay for the company.

We all understand that no company can afford to hire Elon Musk to create a perception of greater innovation happening, so instead companies have to make the consistent effort of spending on R&D to create value to their investors.

Summarizing the analysis and sources of information used:

Focus on improving operating margins, growth and R&D, while avoiding too much focus on top and bottom line

OLS model may not the best one to use when approaching this problem for an implementable model, but gives it gives us the directional relation.

Mcap = 5,419  -  0.1 Sales (FY+1)  +  4.9 EBITDA (FY+1) + 39.8 Long term EPS +  315.0 R&D as a % of sales 

R Square came down from 0.65 to 0.43, also bringing down the MSE residual and total by over 90%
1.	Operating efficiencies and growth
2.	Investing in R&D has proven to have a direct impact of how investors value a company (TODAY)
 
Limitations of the analysis: starting with a data set of over 1900 companies and cutting they to around 500 was disheartening but necessary as most of the companies donâ€™t report R&D expenses as a line item on their income statement. But in the end 500 was a pretty good data set to understand the fundamental relation between R&A and the market cap.

Objective was to run a regression analysis with variables ranging from forecasted sales to beta to eps and look at the general pattern of what variables play a role in higher valuation.

Information sources that I tapped into were ThomsonOne Analytics and FirstCall Estimates which were the standard financial databases that offer the information on company estimates as well as their fundamentals.
